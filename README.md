(INTAKE) - In osTicket, ticket intake is simple and efficient. Users can submit tickets through various channels like the web portal, email, or API. Once a ticket is created, it’s automatically logged into the system, where it’s assigned a unique ID for tracking. Support agents can view, prioritize, and respond to tickets from the admin panel, ensuring timely and organized communication. Properly categorizing and assigning tickets to the right department helps streamline the support workflow and improves response times.

(ASSIGNMENT) - To assign tickets in osTicket, start by logging into the admin panel and navigating to the “Tickets” tab. Open the ticket you want to assign, then click the “Assign” button. From the dropdown menu, choose the appropriate agent or team responsible for handling the ticket. Once assigned, the agent or team will receive a notification, and the ticket’s status will reflect its new assignment. Proper assignment ensures accountability and helps streamline the resolution process, making sure tickets are handled efficiently and by the right personnel.
